## Problem

lack of Security during elections, thereby putting the lifes of citizens at great risk, also due to bad governance, Votes are not secured, i.e. the citizens votes are not counted and being manipulated.

## Proposed Solution

A decentralized Voting Application which is autonomous and runs on the ethereum blockchain. These application will allow users with a unique blockchain address/voter id vote only once, once user casts vote, the vote is being recorded and cannot be changed again, Thereby making the system corruption free.

## Proposed Stack

Web3Js, Javascript, Solidity, Truffle

## Benefits

- Each Blockchain Address/Voters Id is allowed to vote only once
- Citizens will be able to vote from their living room, not scared of being harrased by electoral and security bodies at theri polling unit.
- Results cannot be manipulated and votes are secured
- Platform has no central authority, therefore making the application safe
